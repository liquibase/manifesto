## Liquibase Manifesto
**The values which guide the Liquibase organization, culture, and remote work.**

1.  We uphold our values of integrity, empathy, and accountability.
    
2.  We encourage teamwork and celebrating achievements.
    
3.  No punks, no jerks. We are committed to helping each other succeed and grow, and value our diverse backgrounds and experience.
    
4.  Flexible working hours over set working hours. The results of work over the hours put in.
    
5.  We empower people to challenge the status quo in surprising ways. This includes questioning meetings, processes, and product direction.
    
6.  It is the DRIâ€™s (Directly Responsible Individual) responsibility to inform and include others.
    
7.  We write down processes and make them easy to find.
    
8.  We are transparent, and we value & strive to accept feedback.
    
9.  Everyone can contribute, but the buck stops with the DRI. After a decision is made, we don't re-hash it and we stand behind it unless significant information presents itself.
    
10.  We create raving fans.
